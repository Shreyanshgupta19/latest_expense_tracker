This is important for the Dismissible widget because it needs a way to identify each item uniquely. When an item is dismissed, Flutter needs to know which item was dismissed, and the key helps in achieving that.

It's passing expenses[index] as an argument, indicating which expense item should be removed from the list. The onRemoveExpense function is likely designed to handle the logic of removing the corresponding expense from the data source.
